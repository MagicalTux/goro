I implemented the following functions:
key(), current(), next(), reset(), prev() and end()

Each of this functions takes only an $array as a parameter,
so it requires storing the state (current item, next item etc.)
in the array itself, which the documentation 
refer to as "internal pointer".

There's already an existing hashtable iterator, so I
just need to add a new field. Initially, I added
it on ZArray, but it seems there's a bug where
the deleted flag isn't assigned anywhere. There's
also other complications, of which I could avoid
if I just put the iterator in the hashtable instead.

Then I implemented the sort() function.
