I managed to finish most of the items
listed in the top most commonly used php functions:
https://github.com/BaseMax/TopPHPFunctions
I skipped the filesystem functions for now,
as well as the and preg_* since they aren't part of ext/standard.

So now I'm just going to focus in adding array functions
for next few working days. The diff functions have a lot
in common especially the udiff ones, but I just
mostly copy-pasted the code. I'll probably refactor
them later.

As aside, it seems there's another compiler bug
where it throws a nil error when using a class constructor.
I'll probably segue into fixing that next week first
things first.

I implemented the following functions:
key(), current(), next(), reset(), prev() and end()

Each of this functions takes only an $array as a parameter,
so it requires storing the state (current item, next item etc.)
in the array itself, which the documentation 
refer to as "internal pointer".

There's already an existing hashtable iterator, so I
just need to add a new field. Initially, I added
it on ZArray, but it seems there's a bug where
the deleted flag isn't assigned anywhere. There's
also other complications, of which I could avoid
if I just put the iterator in the hashtable instead.

Then I implemented the sort() function.
